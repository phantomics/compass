## Documentation — Compass

Project documentation follows **Compass** (Common Ontological Model for Prose
Artifacts by Structural Standard). Use the `compass-*` skills rather than
improvising documents:

- `compass-author` — scaffold a new document (Survey/Eval/Plan/Log/Ref/Guide/
  Spec/Arch/Glossary/Memo) with correct front-matter and per-genre section shape.
- `compass-review` — the toolchain's checks plus a judgment-level review before
  accepting a doc.
- `compass-lookup` — resolve identifiers, sections, records, and references.

The skills carry the standard and its reference bundle. Load @Compass.md on
demand only if you need the source text — do not preload it.

Run `compass check` before finishing any change to the documentation, and fix
the errors it reports in the files you changed. `compass help` lists the other
commands (`show`, `outline`, `refs`, `index`, `rules`).

Project-specific facts the skills cannot infer (fill these in):

- Compass namespace: <NAMESPACE>            <!-- e.g. ORIGIN; also in compass.sexp -->
- Docs directory: doc/                       <!-- flat; grouping via front-matter -->
- The `compass` command: <on the PATH, or a path to bin/compass>
- Federated repositories (if any): <namespace and path of each, as in compass.sexp>

Essentials (full rules in Compass.md): every document opens with a §7 YAML
front-matter block; genre and status use the controlled vocabularies; decision
records are ADR-shaped (`D`-records); new documents and their records keep
provisional `<NAMESPACE>-DRAFT-<slug>` identifiers until a steward assigns
numbers; code references in Log/Plan are commit-pinned (`path:symbol@revision`),
never bare line numbers; documents authored with LLM help carry `provenance:`;
an assistant never sets `approved-by` or an authoritative status.
